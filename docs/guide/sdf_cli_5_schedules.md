# Schedules and Workflows


TBD
<!-- 
**Example** Let's assume we have a daily table and we want to write `sink` partitioned by day as well. 
(1) Install
> `sdf new . --sample input-partitions-to-output-partitions`

(2) 

(2) We have to add a partition specification to `sink`. This can be done via a sink.das.yml file, which we find here:
> `cat src/sinks.das.yml`
```yaml
.sdfcache
└── output_files
    └── public
        └── main
            └── part-0.parquet
```
(3) 

> `sdf build`

> `tree .sdfcache`

```yaml
.sdfcache
└── output_files
    └── public
        └── main
            └── part-0.parquet
``` -->
